  <h1><img src="assets/logo.png" alt="jTreatsLogo">Proposal</h1>
    <div class="proposal">
      <h2>I would like to start a for-charity ongoing “bake sale” called <span id="jT">jTreats</span> for my time at Prime. The overall concept is:</h2>
        <ul id="overview">
          <li>Bring baked-at-home treats to be available in the commons</li>
            <li>People pay (i.e. donate) electronically by honor system, to a dedicated account</li>
              <li><span id="proceeds">100% of proceeds</span> after food cost will be donated to organizations that promote STEM fields to underserved communities in MN</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="synergy">
      <h2>This idea has synergy between four things important to me:</h2>
        <ol id="fourThings">
          <li>My love to bake and share treats</li>
            <li>My desire to contribute positively to our greater community </li>
              <li>It will start momentum for my solo project</li>
                <li>It may help me in my future job search, whether by connections I may make through it or just <span style="color:#184890">by showing personal initiative</span></li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    <div class="points">
      <h2>Of course there are also some concerns associated with this kind of idea. I will address what I see as the biggest ones:</h2>
        <h3 class= "topic">Safety and Liability:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>It appears <a href="https://www.mda.state.mn.us/food-feed/cottage-food-law-guidance#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99re%20not%20regularly%20engaged%20in%20selling%20food%2C%20as%20defined%20in%C2%A0Minnesota%20Statute%2C%20then%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20register.%20However%2C%20if%20you%20regularly%20sell%20cottage%20food%20at%20these%20types%20of%20venues%20or%20directly%20from%20your%20home%2C%20then%20you%20do%20need%20to%20register.">selling food items as a benefit for charity</a> does not <a href="#"></a>immediately require licensing, but <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/28A.03#:~:text=Regularly%20engaged.%20%22Regularly%20engaged%22%20means%20any%20person%20who%20operates%20a%20food%20business%20over%20a%20period%20of%20time%20at%20uniform%2C%20consistent%20intervals.">regular sales do</a>. As such, I have applied for a MN Cottage Food Producer license, and will follow all the attendant safety and labeling guidelines (including before the license is issued)</li>
          </ul>
        <h3 class= "topic">Personal workload:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>As a professional baker, I have a good grasp on the level of effort I can afford to expend without negatively affecting my studies at Prime or other personal commitments</li>
          </ul>
        <h3 class= "topic">Transparency in proceeds/donations:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I would eventually create a website that will have a ticker for dollars donated, and maybe treats sold</li>
              <li>I might potentially share my food cost spreadsheets, or if not the spreadsheets at least the total food costs</li>
          </ul>
